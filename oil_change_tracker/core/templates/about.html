    <h1 class="my-4">About This Project</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my car oil change tracker project! This is my first project using Django, and I built it to help users keep track of their vehicle maintenance, specifically oil changes. The application allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Register and manage their account.</li>
        <li>Record and view oil change history for each vehicle.</li>
        <li>Set reminders for future oil changes based on mileage or date.</li>
        <li>Manage multiple vehicles and track each one's maintenance separately.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The project is built with Django, a powerful Python framework, and includes features such as user authentication, CRUD operations for vehicle records, and email reminders.</p>

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>This project was created by Jakub Naiman as part of learning Django. Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jakubnaiman97@gmail.com">jakubnaiman97@gmail.com</a> for any questions or feedback.</p>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <p>In the future, I plan to add more features such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Support for more vehicle maintenance records.</li>
        <li>Additional user roles and permissions.</li>
        <li>Improved reminder system with notifications.</li>
    </ul>
